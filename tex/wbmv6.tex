\subsection{Ping Results Table}

The folloing verbatim table lists statistics per experiment (EXP) and group (GRP) as calculated by the lua-based
evaluation script based on the raw ping-measurements data and outputted to the file ping.stat.
Event based results are given for each received icmp response in ping.data.
