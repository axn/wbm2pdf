\section{Testbed ad Experiment Descripiton}

\subsection{Deployment}

During the first days of the event a total of 20 wibed nodes have been
deployed. 16 wibed-nodes have beend spread over 3 different floors in
the main event building. About 10 of these 16 nodes were located in
the main event hall (approximately 300 sqare-meters workshop room)
with highest node density in a particular corner of this room
(deathroom in Note \ref{locations}) and the 6 in the below and above floor of the event
hall. Three more nodes have been placed in a neighboring building with
wireless connectivity.  One node was battery powerded for allowing
mobile-node scenarios.  In fact not all node positions were always
exactly known as nodes were sometimes moved to fullfill specific
experimentation-scenario requirements.  In each building 1 of the
wibed-nodes were configured as GW nodes and blocked for experimental
usage. The remaining 18 nodes were shared between three different
experimentation groups for running tests and different scenarios (each
node was used by at most one experimentation group at any time).

All experiments were performed in a single 5Ghz channel. However, due
to the presence of around 50 participans with wireless laptops and
several other actively used wireless equipment, also the used 5GHz
channel was likely affected by non-testbed related interference.

The experiment presented in this work was lead by one of these groups
and used the following 16 nodes:

\subsection{Protocol Configurations and Assumptions}
The highly dynamic and uncontrollable interference in the measurement
environment made it inpossible to ensure equal conditions for
sequential experiment executions. Therefore, to ensure equal (fair)
environment conditions for all tested protocols, all routing protocols
were running and observed in parallel on all nodes, thus all being
always exposed to the exactly same environmental conditions. 

The accepted downside of this approach is of course that protocol
overhead introduced by one protocol or by protocol-observing tools
like ping (causing total overhead in the order of few KB/s, as can be
seen from later measurements) slightly affects the maximum achievable
end-to-end throughput of other protocols (in the order of seveal
MB/s).

Only netperf-tcp-based throughput probes, seeking to measure the
achievable tcp performance of the end-to-end routing paths established
by the individual protocols, were performed sequentially. This
decision has been made because each netperf test trys to load the
capacity of a given end-to-end path with a maximum of traffic, thus
introducing maximum probing-traffic overhead and interference while on
the other hand (given the tcp-inherent exponential backoff approach)
drastically lowering the currently offered load in the presence of
packet loss, leading to highly randomized results when running in
parallel and making the comparatin of parallel executions difficult.


All protocols were configured for routing IPv6 traffic using an
individual ULA address prefix per protocol. 

All protocols were configured with default parametrizations, thus no
environment specific customizations have been made apart from ensuring
the routing of the given IPv6 address range. The exact configuration
can be accessed via \cite{wbm-config}.

To avoid protocol-bootstrapping effects (eg unfinished neighbor-,
path- or topology-discovery), all routing protocol deamons were
started at least 200 seconds before any measurement.

\subsection{Measurement Configuration and Assumptions}

Followup measurements were executed from a singe selected node
(src-node) by launching a pre-deployed test script \cite{wbm-test} and
given the id of a single other node (dst-node) for probing end-to-end
path characteristics. Src-node and dst-node IDs for each measurement
are given in Note \ref{locations}.

Each followup measurement last 200 seconds during which the following
additional tools were used to observe protocol performance and
overhead: 
\begin{itemize}
\item ping6 (unix) command to dst-node ipv6 address with one-second interval
  and 1000 bytes icmp user data. The output of the ping6 command got
  logged for later end-to-end packet loss, hop-count, and round-trip
  time (RTT) over time analysis.

\item top (unix) command for logging protocol-specific CPU and memory
  consumption at 1 second intervals.

\item mtr (my trace route, unix) command at 1 second interval for
  tracing full src-to-dst protocol-established path information. Due
  to the difficulty to correlate or graphically represent these traces,
  the obtained log files were not processed further.

\item netperf, executed in repeating rounds (4 rounds), each probing
  sequentially the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput to always
  the same destination node for 10 seconds via each routing protocol.
  
\item tcpdump, passively capturing the present routing-protocol
  overhead of each protocol as reveived on the wireless channel by the
  src node.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiments}

The experiment focused on measuring the overhead and performance of 5
different mesh routing protocol implementations in static and mobile
scenarios. The five tested protocols were batman-advanced (batadv),
bmx6, olsr, olsr2, and babel. Unfortunately, we just discovered after
the measurements that the babel protocol daemon was not configured
correctly, leading to broken routing decisions for multi-hop
path. Therefore all babel-protocol related measurements were discareded
in the following discussion.

Experiments are grouped in two different scenarios (wibed experiments
with results accessible via corresponding wibed-data repositories as
given in Note \ref{resources} for exp-16 and exp-19 ), each scenario
consisted of about 4 measurement executions by using different
source-destination combinatinos (measurement results were stored on
the source-node of the measurement as given by Note \ref{locations}).
In the following the two scenarios and selected measrurement results
are discussed.  The complete set of obtained measurement results and
resulting graphs are given graph tables \ref{tbl:s-pings} to
\ref{tbl:m:4}.

\subsubsection{Stationary scenario}

During the stationary scenario the involved wibed nodes were not
moved, however still affected by uncontrollable interference
conditions from the environment itself, other parallel experiments
executed on other wibed nodes and the traffic created by the
experiments itself. For each measurement a couple of source

\section{Recommendations for next battlemesh}

\begin{itemize}

\item Traceroute and mrt often show  high packet for intermediate nodes. This is due to a kind of denial-of-service mechanism enabled by default in Linux kernel. WIth this mechanism the kernel simply discards frequent icmp responses (eg due to exceeded TTL values). This behavior can be disabled by lowering the default net.ipv6.icmp.ratelimit=1000 setting, eg via: sysctl -w net.ipv6.icmp.ratelimit=10
